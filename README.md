# api-to--csv

### ABOUT

Getting data from an API has never been this easy. In this project, we fetch weather data from an API and incrementally load it into a CSV file. As new data is fetched, it is appended to the CSV file. From there, data can be handed off to data analysts for further analysis and computation.

### PROBLEM BEING SOLVED

Fetching data from a source often involves using many resources. Previously, I worked on a project that involved loading data from an API into Kafka, then processing it with Flink, and finally storing it in PostgreSQL. However, I wanted a simpler approach that would be less resource-intensive. This project demonstrates an approach where we fetch data from an API and directly load it into a CSV file that keeps appending new data as it is generated.

### GETTING STARTED

To work on this project, follow these steps:
1. **Create a virtual environment:** Ensure you have Python installed, then create a virtual environment using `python -m venv myenv`.
2. **Clone the repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. **Install dependencies:** Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. **Get your API key:** Sign up on the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get your API key.
5. **Run the script:** Customize the script as needed and run it to start fetching and storing weather data.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs!
